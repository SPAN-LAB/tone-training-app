# Tone Training App

This application is designed to train participants using different auditory feedback modes like production training and perception training with minimal or full feedback. 

## Features
- **Perception with Minimal Feedback**: Participants hear sounds and respond with minimal feedback on correctness.
- **Perception with Full Feedback**: Participants get full feedback on their responses, including whether they were right or wrong.
- **Production Training**: Participants replicate sounds and get feedback based on how accurately they reproduce them.
